# Step 6: Badges

In README, you may add some badge icons so that GitHub visitors can recognize the project status at a glance.

Here I list a few example projects that use badges well.
Please check out the source of their READMEs and change the repository references to fit with yours.

* [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)
* [nirum](https://github.com/spoqa/nirum)

You can see that some badges are natively provided by CI/external services while some others are just decorative by being generated with static texts.
