# Step 8: GitHub Extras

If you are hosting your project on GitHub, you can customize the default templates for issue bodies and PR decsriptions!

Create `.github` directory and just add:

* `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` -- issue template
* `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` -- PR description template
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` -- the contribution guideline

Again, a good example is [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/tree/master/.github).

Check out [the GitHub's official docs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/) as well.
